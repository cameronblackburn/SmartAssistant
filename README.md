Personal project for the creation of a custom smart assistant with the goal of embedding to custom devices.

CASE, the personal assistant will be able to function like any other smart 
assistant, however, with the hopes of taking advantage of open-source code, 
CASE will be able to parse inputs and provide custom GUI feedback for a range 
of features!
