# Specifications for "CASE" (Context-Aware System Entity)

## Version: 0.01
*Date: 2025-06-04*

## 1. Overview

This document defines the technical specifications for the minimal viable CASE assistant, based on the requirements in `Requirements.md`. It outlines how the system components will behave and interact.

---

## 2. System Architecture

- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Environment:** Cross-platform (development on Windows, eventual deployment on Linux)
- **Design:** Modular, CLI-based prototype
- **Offline-capable:** All features must run locally

---

## 3. Modules & Responsibilities

### 3.1 CLI Input Handler
- Listens for and sanitizes command line input
- Tokenizes and routes commands to appropriate handler

### 3.2 Command Parser
- Matches input to predefined symbolic commands
- Falls back with “Unknown command” response if unmatched

### 3.3 TTS Engine
- Uses `pyttsx3` for offline speech
- Wraps `speak(text)` interface
-  `pyttsx3` as fallback for: `gTTS` or `Coqui` (future dependency integration)

## 4. Command Set (v0.01)

| Command | Description             | Example Output          |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| time    | Says the system time     | “It is 14:35”            |
| date    | Says the system date     | “Today is 2025-06-04” / "Today is the 27th of December 1977"   |
| exit    | Terminates the session   | “Goodbye.”               |

---

## 5. Interfaces & I/O

- **Input:** CLI (via `input()`)
- **Output:** Text to console + TTS audio
- **Error Handling:** Print to console + optional verbal error

---

## 6. Dependencies

- `pyttsx3`
- `datetime` (standard lib)
- `sys` (for graceful exit)

---

## 7. Future Considerations

- GUI module (TBD)
- Natural language command parsing
- Contextual memory or state
- Neural network integration for fuzzy commands
